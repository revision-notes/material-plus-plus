Material++
==========

Material++ is my extension to mkdocs-material, for the use of Revision Notes.

## Changes

- Prevent *good* search engines from indexing the site
- Add reference to humans.txt
- Use `|` to separate titles, not `-` 
- 404 Page
  - Improved the content, to include a contact email
  - Give the page a proper title
- Fonts
  - Change the default font to `Noto Sans`, from `Roboto Sans`
  - Split the `font.code` setting into two settings: `font.pre` and `font.code`
  - Do not handle with Google Fonts for `font.code`

## Notes

- **`font.code` will only work with CodeHilite**
