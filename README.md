Material++
==========

Material++ is my extension to mkdocs-material, for the use of School Revision Notes.

## Changes

- Change the default font to `Noto Sans`, from `Roboto Sans`
- Split the `font.code` setting into two settings: `font.pre` and `font.code`
- Do not handle fonts with Google Fonts for `font.code`

## Notes

- **`font.code` will only work with CodeHilite**
